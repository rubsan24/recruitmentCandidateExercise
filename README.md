# Adstock Model 

The *Adstock regression model* proposed here aims to explain how a brandâ€™s advertising spend has influenced the levels of weekly Google Search volumes through an adstock function that takes into account the proportion of media pressure carried over from week to week. The model also incorporates information about the three different non-overlapping advertising campaigns used by the brand. 

A table compairing results in terms of efficiency per campagin is provided as well as the model fit specified by the desired retention factor.
